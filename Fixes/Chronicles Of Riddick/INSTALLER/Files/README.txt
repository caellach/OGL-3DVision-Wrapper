The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Athena - 3D Vision Patch.
=========================================================

DO NOT USE IT with other games or it will crash !!!

WORKS ONLY WITH A LEGIT STEAM VERSION !!!

The project is based and uses a modified version of "opengl-3d-vision-bridge" library created by "Tal Liron."
(https://github.com/tliron/opengl-3d-vision-bridge)



=========================
Important:
=========================

A lot of effort went into creating this fix: a profile so people can take advantage of SLI, 3D Visio Surround and other OGL optimizations.
The 3D Vision rendering  was tweaked to provide the best experience. The profile comes with a set
convergence.

!!!! I recommend using the convergence value that comes with the nvidia profile !!

However, if you don't like it, you can change the convergence, but it will also break SSAO and Bloom.
If these effects are disabled, the game renders as expected without any other problems.

!!!! In order for the game to render in stereo 3D you must PRIOR to installing the wrapper to go ingame and set the refresh rate to 120HZ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



==========================
Fixed
=========================

- Some shadows were removed
- Countles shaders for Post-Processing, shadows, lights, UI, object position etc
- Some scenes have objects that render at wrong depth.
- The Fog/Smoke produces halos.

Support for 3 Convergence/Depth Presets:

1. F2 - use it in menus or if you find the wrong rendered scenes to bother you
2. F3 - extereme convergence. - Use it if you wish, when running around.
3. F4 - resets to the values set in the nvidia Profile (or set by you, the user, using the nVidia keys)

- On some Laptops and some systems when the game starts, 3D Vision kicks in but a black screen is displayed. To fix this go to Nvidia Panel->Stereoscopic 3D tab and under "Select when the display is in 3D Mode"
select "Always."

=========================
Supports:
=========================
- Both Window mode and fullscreen.
- Supports convergence, separation and depth adjustments from nvidia panel (or via hotkeys).
- Tested on Single GPU/ SLI 3D Vision setups
- Tested on 3D Vision Surround setups
- Reported to WORK with 3DTVPlay



=========================
BUGS and KNOWN ISSUES:
=========================

- Some scenes have elements rendered at wrong depth/separation. I cannot fix them without breaking other things.
- Some shadows clip in one eye in extreme angles. I cannot fix them without breaking other things.
- The menu requires the use of the hotkey (F2)
- Don't go to high with the settings or the eyes will not sync!!!!
