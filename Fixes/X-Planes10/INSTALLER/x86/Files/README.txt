=========================================================
X-Planes 10 - 3D Vision Patch - x86.
=========================================================

==========================
In-Game Graphical settings:
=========================
- Best to run in Fullscreen.
- Set Shadows to either Static or Overlay
- Disable Water Reflections.
- Enable "per pixel lighting"
- HDR lighting is supported, but honestly I find only to darken the screen way to much and I recommend against it.

==========================
Fixed
=========================
- Everyting except:
	- Point Lights.
	- Water reflections.
	- Dynamic Shadows.
- Alternative preset for different convergence while using the "cockpit" view.
  Default bind is on the Middlle Mouse Button. Can be changed from 3DVisionWrapper.ini file (found in the game folder)
	
	
=========================
BUGS and KNOWN ISSUES:
=========================
- Wrapper Resize Option is not supported.


=========================
Supports:
=========================
- Both Window mode and fullscreen.
- Supports convergence, separation and depth adjustments from nvidia panel (or via hotkeys).
- Tested on Single GPU/ SLI 3D Vision setups
- Tested on 3D Vision Surround setups (Game suffers from a FOV issue in this mode, not recommended).
- Reported to WORK with 3DTVPlay


=========================
Important:
=========================

A lot of effort went into creating this fix: a profile so people can take advantage of SLI, 3D Visio Surround and other OGL optimizations.
The 3D Vision rendering  was tweaked to provide the best experience. The profile comes with a set
convergence.
